# Organizational Political Stratification: Extent, Causes, and Effects

*with Justin Frake, Rueben Hurst, and Max Kagan*

## Abstract

This paper examines how political stratification emerges within organizations, exploring the extent, causes, and effects of political sorting among employees. Using novel survey data, we document systematic patterns of political clustering across organizational hierarchies and functions.

## Methodology

This study uses a mixed-methods approach combining large-scale survey data with organizational network analysis. Survey data was collected from employees at 50 organizations spanning multiple industries. Network data was gathered through organizational communication records and validated through self-reported tie surveys.
